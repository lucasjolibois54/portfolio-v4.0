    <p>
      Hi! My name is Lucas and I enjoy designing & creating things that live on
      the internet. My interest in informatics started back in 2017 when I
      decided To study computer science in highschool. Back then I was building
      & Developing circuits with arduino. â€” All of that led me to where I am
      now! At the moment I am a student at Zealand Business Academy, studying
      Multimedia designer. I have developed at larger reach of interest within
      Web- development and graphic design. At the moment my biggest Interests
      are in UX & UI- design, web- development, logo design, Graphic design and
      things within that niche.
