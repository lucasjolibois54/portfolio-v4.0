            Creating this logo was pretty fun. I don’t design & create logos
            that often, so I’m glad I got the possibility to design this.
            Additionally I’m also pretty glad about the results. My results
            ended up looking exacly like what I was going for. The design looks
            clean, and it’s easy to understand what the brand does and it's
            related to.
