            While working at Global Scanning, I’ve gotten pretty familiar with
            WordPress, though creating a webshop while also styling it from the
            local serving using SQL, was something that I hadn’t tried before,
            so im glad that everything went well. I ended up with a nice small
            poster webshop which also could get accessed online through WP once
            uploaded.
